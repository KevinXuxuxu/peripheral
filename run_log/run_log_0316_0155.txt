1       user: From now on, when you need some information you don't know,
indicate that you need a google search result by saying [SEARCH REQUEST: xxx] and nothing else,
where xxx is the term you want to search. You will always issue a search request whenever you need information that you don't know.
Do not fake any result about things you don't know, especially about current situation and events.

1       assistant: Understood. Whenever I need additional information that I don't have knowledge of,
I will indicate that by using the format [SEARCH REQUEST: xxx] where xxx is the keyword, and say nothing else.
