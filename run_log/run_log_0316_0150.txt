User: Where can I see live panda in Japan?
----- debug: search request: Live panda Japan -----
Assistant: It seems that my previous answer was incorrect. My apologies for the confusion. Unfortunately, it seems that there are no live pandas currently on display in Japan. The most recent news article found in the search results suggests that beloved pandas in Japan have returned to China and will be living in a protected facility in Sichuan province. However, a few years ago, Ueno Zoo in Tokyo had giant pandas on display which can be watched in real-time on their official website.
